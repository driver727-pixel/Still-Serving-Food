# Still-Serving-Food 🍔

> **Find out which bars & restaurants are still serving food — right now.**

The internet is full of open/close hours for venues, but almost nothing tells you when the **kitchen** or **grill** closes. Still Serving Food scrapes venue websites with [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and surfaces **food-service hours only** — no liquor hours, no vague "open" times.

---

## Features

- 🔍 **Location search** — enter any city or neighbourhood to find nearby venues
- 🤖 **Firecrawl-powered scraping** — extracts grill hours, kitchen hours, and hot-food hours directly from venue websites
- 🟢 **Live "Serving Now" status** — tells you at a glance whether food is being served at this very moment
- 🕐 **Full weekly schedule** — expandable hour tables for every day of the week
- ⚡ **10-minute result cache** — avoids redundant scrapes on repeat searches
- 🔴 **"Opens at" info** — shows when food service begins if not currently serving

## How it works

1. You enter a location in the search box.
2. The server calls Firecrawl's `/search` API with a query like  
   `bars restaurants grill food hours "Brooklyn, NY"`.
3. For each result Firecrawl returns (up to 12), the markdown content of the page is parsed by `hoursParser.js`.
4. The parser looks for food-section keywords (grill, kitchen, food, dining …) and then extracts day/time patterns from the surrounding text.
5. The current local time is compared against the parsed hour windows to produce a **Serving Now** or **Not Serving** status.
6. Results are displayed on the page and cached for 10 minutes.
